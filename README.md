## About The Project

![Screen Shot](screenshot.png)

Speed Typing Game Application Create a Speed Typing game application where players can practice and compete against each other.

Practice/Solo Mode: • A game mode for player to practice and improve their typing skills. • Player can choose the level of difficulty and game duration. • Player can visualize the typed text progress and real-time typing speed. • Once the game ends, the results (e.g., accuracy and typing speed) will be shown to the player.

Multi-Player Mode: • A game mode to test your skills against other speedsters. • Player can choose the level of difficulty and will be put in a lobby with other players who choose the same difficulty. • In a particular lobby, all players are shown the same paragraph as the typing challenge. • In addition to the player's personal progress, they can also visualize other players' progress. • On game end, the results (e.g., accuracy, typing speed and lobby rank of each player) of all the players in the lobby will be displayed.
